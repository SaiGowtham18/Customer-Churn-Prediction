# Customer Churn Prediction for Banks
📉 **Predicting Bank Customer Retention Using Logistic Regression**

## 📌 Project Overview
This project builds a **predictive model** using **Logistic Regression** to analyze customer churn in banking. 
By identifying key factors influencing customer retention, the model helps optimize engagement strategies to reduce churn.

## 📊 About the Data
- **Dataset**: Banking customer records with demographics, transactions, and engagement metrics.  
- **Features**:
  - **Customer ID**: Unique identifier for each bank client.
  - **Account Balance**: Financial standing of the customer.
  - **Transaction Frequency**: Usage behavior over time.
  - **Churn Indicator**: Label indicating if the customer left the bank.
- **Source**: Public banking dataset for churn analysis.

## 🎯 Goals
✔ **Develop a predictive model** to classify customer churn likelihood.  
✔ **Identify key factors** affecting customer retention.  
✔ **Provide insights** to improve banking customer retention strategies.  

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
- **Programming**: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)
- **Data Processing**: Feature Selection, Data Cleaning, One-Hot Encoding  
- **Machine Learning**: Logistic Regression, Model Evaluation (Confusion Matrix, ROC Curve)  
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Data Handling**: SQL for customer data retrieval
